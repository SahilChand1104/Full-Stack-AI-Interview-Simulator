Description:
This project is a full-stack AI-powered interview simulator that helps users practice for job interviews. The system uses the Gemini AI API to generate job-specific interview questions, which reduces the preparation time by 90%. Users can answer questions using speech, and their responses are transcribed with a 95% accuracy rate. The system also stores the responses in a PostgreSQL database, allowing users to review and redo interviews.

Features:
AI Interview Question Generation: Leverages the Gemini AI API to provide job-specific interview questions.
Speech-to-Text Integration: React Hook for speech-to-text transcription with high accuracy.
User-Friendly UI: Built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN for a consistent and intuitive front end.
Interview History: PostgreSQL-powered system for storing past interviews and feedback.
